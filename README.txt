This is a tamplate that will be completely customized to suite my portfolio needs, but I give HTML5up credit for designing such a brilliant website and for having some of my favorite web designs. I enjoy a lot of their templates and highly suggest any client to check them out for finding good templates. I also suggest signing up for the subscription to get even more designs.

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
