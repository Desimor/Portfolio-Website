								<span class="image main"><img src="images/tech.jpg" alt="Servers" height="160px"/></span>
								<p>The future is limitless which gives me room to fill it with my limitless imagination. I'm a Web Developer and a Programmer, but I'm also entrepreneurial in spirit. I dream of creating amazing applications or designing programs universally used. Check them out <a href="#work">here</a>.</p>
								
								<p>I specifically love start-ups and have had the chance to work on a few in the past, but I, as of right now in 2017, am striving to increase my value as a Web Developer so that I will be highly desirable by companies. I've accomplished much, but I have bigger dreams that will challenge the way I work and think. Someday I will create complex applications that simplify work flow in various situations. I love efficiency.</p>

								<p>The first of my projects was good enough for my client, but my work has progressed tremendously since I first started.</p>
								<p>At first I could only do HTML and CSS. Not much to write home about. I could barely understand responsiveness, but for my clients, it was good enough. I've worked hard and diligently since then to sharpen my craft. Now I'm not only significantly better at HTML and CSS, but I know the methods of making the site responsive. Even more than that, I am currently working on a project that requires a lot of Javascript, React specifically, postgress database, and good ol' ingenuity. </p>

								<p>I'm still not the developer I want to be. I've come very far, but I have so far to go. Every chance I get, I'm always reading something about programming and languages, I'll listen to Developer podcasts while falling asleep, I work on projects with a friend of mine who works for Google as a software engineer, and I constantly find more ways to immerse myself in code. It's not just because I want a job, but because I've finally found something I genuinely like learning about and doing even in my free time. I do not regret the work I've done in other fields, but I'm glad to be here finally. Something I can truly say I'm passionate about.</p>

							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/aboutpic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p><strong>TL:DR</strong></br>
								Previously Multimedia Director for Bit Cauldron, Network Infrastructure Technician for UF, A/V Specialist for various churches. Accomplished a lot on personality alone. Now settling into Web Development, working hard to match value as a Developer to personality.</p>

								<p><strong>Original</strong></br>
								Dating back to my pre-teens, I remember being taught to build my first computer and was immediately hooked. At that moment, I obtained an insatiable thirst for Technology that has been on going up to the present. Since then, I have explored many avenues to quench that thirst.</p>
								
								<p>I remember as a kid, trying to create my own server for one of my favorite games using MySQL to run it. I started to fix computers for people after that point. Someone introduced me to the sound board at church and from there, I did stage production for years running entire shows till I started getting paid to do Audio/Video production for events. In highschool, we had just got an experimental class that taught us all Adobe Products such as InDesign, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, etc. We even got certified in Photoshop and Dreamweaver. Dual enrolled at our local college, I took a programming 101 course that was subpar which turned me away at first. But then as I became a Director of Multimedia at a software company called Bit Cauldron, I worked closely with a graphics designer who showed me code when she was building the website. It peeked my interest once again.</p>
								
								<p>After that contract was up, I moved on to get a job at University of Florida as a Network Infrastructure Technician. From there I dived in to coding Cisco switches and helped build out entire network infrastructures of different buildings such as the Library, Science, Engineering, etc. Some of my own personal projects were setting up a chain of Cisco switches for gaming events done by Gator Gaming. After that job, I became a Logistics Manager for an online business called Remedium LLC. However, by that point, I knew exactly where I wanted to be. A programmer, web developer, and software engineer. I did particularly like networks, but I enjoyed the coding behind it. I didn't like my schedule bound by events like in stage production, but I enjoyed giving people a show and something to see.</p>
								
								<p>You are probably wondering how I accomplished all this in such a short time especially since I'm so young. Well, I am extremely quick witted, I learn extraordinarly fast, but I also have to give a lot of credit to my personality. I tend to win people over by personality alone and I'm very good at selling myself or anything for that matter. However, that comes with it's limitations. I've accomplished a lot on personality and people's skills alone, but none of the jobs I had, I deserved. In terms of value as an employee, I was always learning as I go which got me far enough to survive, but I intend on changing that. I've settled on what career I want and I've been increasing my skills since. Now, a year later, I have grown tremendously, but I continue to grow exponentially so that my value as an employee will match my personality.</p>
